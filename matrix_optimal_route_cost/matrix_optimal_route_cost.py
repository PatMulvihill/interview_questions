# Given a matrix of size w * h, where w = 3 and h = 3 like so:
#   [5 3 2]
#   [2 0 5]
#   [0 4 2]
# Calculate the optimal (lowest cost) route you can take to get from (0, 0) (top left corner)
# to (w - 1, h - 1) (bottom right corner). Each step taken can either be a step to the right (x + 1)
# or a step down (y + 1).  You cannot backtrack.
